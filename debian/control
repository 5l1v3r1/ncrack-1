Description: High-speed network authentication cracking tool
 Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. 
 It was built to help companies secure their networks by 
 proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices 
 for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on 
 Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed 
 using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to 
 Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour 
 based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet 
 reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts.
 .
 Ncrack's features include a very flexible interface granting 
 the user full control of network operations, allowing for 
 very sophisticated bruteforcing attacks, timing templates 
 for ease of use, runtime interaction similar to Nmap's and 
 many more. Protocols supported include RDP, SSH, http(s), 
 SMB, pop3(s), VNC, FTP, and telnet.
